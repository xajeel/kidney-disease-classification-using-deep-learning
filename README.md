# Kidney Disease Classification Project

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Kidney Disease Classification project using deep learning techniques. It includes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on ultrasound images to classify kidney disease.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`:** This directory contains the dataset used for training the CNN model.
- **`notebook/`:** Source code for the CNN model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **`web_app/`:** Streamlit web application for kidney disease classification.

## Features

- **CNN Model:** Trained using ultrasound images to classify kidney disease.
- **Streamlit Web App:** Interactive web application for real-time prediction and visualization.
- **Dataset:** Includes a dataset of ultrasound images used for training and evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit Web App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run web_app/app.py
   ```

3. **Access the Web App:**
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to use the web application.

## Future Work

- Improve model accuracy with more diverse datasets.
- Enhance user interface and add additional features to the web application.
- Deploy the web application for public access.
